No Person's Sky species generation bot.

Pull requests welcome, *especially* for more species images. Also, I feel it would be more fun to add new diets and temperaments than are used by the game. Keep them in the right spirit, please!


## Usage

Clone the repo; run `npm install`. Create a file named `.env` in the repo directory and put your Twitter API access tokens in it like so:

```sh
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret
```

Then run `npm start`. Your bot will now be online.
